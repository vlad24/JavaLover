### Disclaimer
When I am free in leisure time I am keen on reading some IT related articles. 
Sometimes you may face some material which you want to get your hands on.
Also sometimes you want to review something you knew, studied, etc. 
Here I dump all things that I have implemented in such cases.
*Also here I put small interview tasks that I was sometime ago asked to implement.*
